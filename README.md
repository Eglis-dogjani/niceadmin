# Project : Niceadmin
> I have done this project for development purposes only.
> In order to watch my project you just need to have a Web Browser installed and a code editor to open .php files. To make the connection with database I have used XAMPP.

## General Information
- In this project I just wanted to learn Server-side language , the so-called PHP 7.
- Basically I have transformed a static web page to a dynamic one with the help of PHP and Sql.
- PHP CRUD website 
- User Register and/or Login.


## Technologies Used
- Html
- Css
- Javascript 
- Php
- MySql


## Features
List the features here :
- Register and/or Login User Forms 
- Insert, Select, Update and Delete Queries.
- Iteration: For, Foreach Loops and Associative Arrays.
- Datatables
- Hashed passwords


## Setup
I have used an Ilustrated phpmyadmin called Localhost in my computer machine by Using XAMPP (Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl).

  $host = 'localhost';
  $username = 'root';
  $password = ' '; //Password field is empty for the Database
  $database_name = 'niceadmin';
  
The Sql file is under the Sqlfile folder.  Handlers included in Includes folder.


## Room for improvement:
- Make more Secure the database by filling a password for DB.
- Use another ways for Hashed Passwords rather than PASSWORD_DEFAULT encryption.
- Increase more features other than just User Registration and Login , Profile Overview, Edit, Change Password and Datatables.

## Contact
Created by Me, Myself and I . Feel free to contact me!
Note: This project is created for development purposes only . I just wanted to learn Concepts of Object Oriented Programming by using PHP . After finishing I can definitely say that if you want to learn OOP Concepts the best way is by learning PHP first.
